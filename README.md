## Description
we're revealing clown world. tensorflow.js, ml5.js and PoseNet are used to draw cagie figures over camera input.
audio playing poem:\
wagie wagie get in cagie\
all day you sweat and ragie\

## Log

### Week 1
* decide that i'm going to make a room with bookshelf, mattress, desk, computer, interactive (done in babylon.js)
* do a bunch of babylon.js tutorials on the babylon.js playground
* spend an inordinate amount of time getting lost editing demos

### Week 2
* change to camouflage idea
* read various papers on the science/maths of camouflage, research computer vision frameworks (opencv etc)
* start teaching myself signals processing stuff (what is an inverse discrete fourier transform? how do i find the fractal dimension of an image? how do i integrate macro and micro scale patterns???? should i just give up and implement a colour averaging / dither algo?)

### Week 3
* break unable to work

### Week 4
* realise that i'm in over my head on the signals processing mathematics to pull this one off in time
* start new project more along the lines of class work
* worked through tfjs / posenet examples directly with html canvas
* got a non-networked version of the room working (NPC figures drawn on HTML canvas over webcam)
* laptop died (RIP)
* realised this would be easier if i integrated p5js, do a little digging and find that someone has made a wrapper for tfjs that works nicely here, it's ml5.js
* start building a networked version from the ground up
